# BTS vs ALL

In this project, our main focus is BTS, one of the most important representatives of kpop culture. As it is known, BTS is a very successful group that got out of the kpop industry and put its name to global work, and we carried out various analyzes in our project based on the success of this group.

We divided our project into three parts. In the first part, we worked with a data set that we can analyze idols, girl groups and boy groups in order to get to know the general structure of the kpop industry. In this part of the study, we analyzed and visualized the technical characteristics of groups and solo singers (average number of members, release date, etc.). Then,  we can answer some questions with the data we analyze. For example, how many members does the group have? Where do idols com from outside of South Korea? Is the gender ratio equal? How many idols and groups have debuted over the years?


In the second part of the project, we performed our analyzes with the data sets we created via Spotify API.  After taking the data of the groups we determined, we first made comments about the average values of KPop songs, and secondly, we updated our dataset by transforming the BTS  data into a target cluster (if BTS is 1, not 0) and trained the models we created with this dataset. We evaluated the performance of the model we trained with different metrics such as Test Score, F1 Score and AUC, and checked whether our model had an overfitting. Then, we compared the performance values we obtained with each other and chose the model with the highest performance.

In the next stage, we took the data of great artists who had great success on a global scale over the Spotify API and applied the same analysis and comparisons to them too.
In the final stage, we obtained the data of all the albums released by BTS and made various analyzes and visualizations with the help of text mining techniques.
